# LearnRxUserSuggestion

Learn Reactive Programming with the great tutorial [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754?utm_campaign=CodeTengu&utm_medium=email&utm_source=CodeTengu_20)
by implementing a simple user suggestion module using Github API.

The original tutorial is in front-end environment, instead I use Node.js and [RxJS 5 (beta)](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS)
to build a similar command line toy for learning purposes, which looks like following:
